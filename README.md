# This repository has moved.

_Yarn_ is a tool for writing dialogue. This repository was the original, but the owner has since passed away. Development has since progressed, and this tool no longer works with the current version. 

Instead, use the [Yarn Spinner Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SecretLab.yarn-spinner). 

If you wish to access the **previous, deprecated version of Yarn**, it is [available here](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnEditor).
